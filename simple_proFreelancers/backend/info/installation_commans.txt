Fix
To address this problem you need to simply run the following commands:

First, remove your current version of virtualenv: pip uninstall virtualenv

Then, remove your current version of pipenv: pip uninstall pipenv

When you are asked Proceed (y/n)? just enter y. This will give you a clean slate.

Finally, you can once again install pipenv and its dependencies: pip install pipenv

This will also install the latest version of virtualenv.

Testing if it worked
Just enter pipenv --version in the command prompt and you should see the desired output.

for installation of flask
>pipenv install flask

to run the flask app
